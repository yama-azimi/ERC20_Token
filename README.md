# AAE Token

## Overview

The AAE Token is an ERC20-compliant smart contract developed on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes standard ERC20 token functionalities along with additional features such as ownership management, pause functionality, and the ability to burn tokens. This contract is designed to provide a comprehensive solution for projects requiring an ERC20 token with enhanced control mechanisms.

## Features

- **ERC20 Standard Compliance**: Implements all standard ERC20 functionalities including transfer, balance tracking, and allowance management.
- **Ownership Management**: Allows the current owner to transfer control of the contract to a new owner.
- **Pausability**: Enables the contract owner to pause and unpause the contract, restricting token transfers during the paused state.
- **Burnability**: Allows token holders to permanently remove tokens from circulation, reducing the total supply.

## Contract Specifications

- **Name**: AAE_Token
- **Symbol**: AAET
- **Decimals**: 18
- **Initial Total Supply**: 1,000,000 tokens (adjustable upon deployment)

## Prerequisites

Before interacting with the AAE Token contract, ensure you have the following:

- An Ethereum wallet capable of deploying smart contracts and interacting with the Ethereum network.
- Enough ETH to cover transaction fees.
- A Solidity compiler (if compiling from source) or access to a compiled version of the contract.
- An environment for deploying and interacting with smart contracts, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat.

## Setup and Deployment

1. **Compile the Contract**: Use the Solidity compiler to compile the `AAE_Token.sol` contract. Ensure you're using a compiler version compatible with Solidity 0.8.23.

2. **Deploy the Contract**: Using your chosen environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat), deploy the compiled contract to the Ethereum network. You will need to provide the initial total supply as a constructor argument if the contract requires it.

3. **Verify Ownership**: After deployment, verify that the deployer's address is set as the owner of the contract.

## Usage

### Basic ERC20 Interactions

- **Transferring Tokens**: Use the `transfer` function to move tokens from your account to another.
- **Checking Balances**: Call `balanceOf` with an address to retrieve the token balance of that address.
- **Approving Spenders**: Use `approve` to allow another address to spend tokens on your behalf.

### Advanced Features

- **Transferring Ownership**: The current owner can transfer ownership by calling `transferOwnership` with the new owner's address.
- **Pausing/Unpausing the Contract**: The owner can pause token transfers by calling `pause` and resume them with `unpause`.
- **Burning Tokens**: Token holders can reduce the total supply by calling `burn` with the amount of tokens they wish to destroy.

## Development and Testing with Foundry

For local development and testing with Foundry:

1. **Install Foundry**: Follow the [Foundry installation guide](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation.html) to install Foundry on your machine.
2. **Writing Tests**: Use Forge, part of the Foundry suite, to write and run tests for your contract. Forge tests are written in Solidity, allowing you to test your contracts in the same language they are written.
3. **Running Tests**: Execute your tests using the `forge test` command in your terminal. Forge provides detailed output on test execution, allowing you to quickly identify and resolve issues.
4. **Security Audits**: Before deploying the contract to a live environment, consider obtaining a security audit from a reputable firm to identify potential vulnerabilities.
